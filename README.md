Database Learnings 

# Description

Mastering advanced databases unlocks the power to efficiently organize, analyze, and extract
valuable insights from vast amounts of data, propelling you toward limitless possibilities in the
world of information and innovation. In this module, students will learn advanced concepts
and techniques in database management systems.

# Objectives

Specific objectives include
- To evaluate and analyze advanced database concepts and techniques.
- To design and develop advanced database systems.

# Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module, students will be able to
1. Evaluate business contexts that benefit from advanced database solutions.
2. Analyze advanced database concepts and techniques, including ACID properties, normalization, design, indexing, performance optimization, DDL, DML, advanced querying, and NoSQL databases.
3. Design and implement advanced database systems to address diverse problem domains.

# Teaching Methods

Students will engage in learning through a series of directed study activities, lectures, and
self-study. The teaching sessions will be divided into two parts. The first part belongs to an
interactive lecture, where students learn about theoretical aspects of the presented topic. The
second part will be an interactive lab, where students will implement the presented concepts
themselves under the guidance of the tutor. Students will be also directed to online materials
for further study.
